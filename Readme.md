The group decided to design a restaurant table booking app which resulted in this prototype.
<br>
The functionality that was buit into the application reflected use cases identified by the group.<br><br>
2 accounts exist by default for evaluating the app.<br>
<br>
Customer login<br>
email: customer<br>
password: pass<br>
<br>
Staff login<br>
